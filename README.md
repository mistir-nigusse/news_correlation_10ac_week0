# Welcome to Week-0 Task-1 of 10 Academy's intensive training program!

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging Git and GitHub for version control, setting up a Python environment, implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and employing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to development environment setup and relevant skills. The project also involves  conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) , perform keyword extraction using KEYBERT, perorm topic modeling to identify which websited are reporting diverse topics, and observe trends, and event modeling, furthermore a postgresSQL is used a s a FeatureSTore
